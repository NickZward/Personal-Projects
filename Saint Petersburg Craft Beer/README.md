![beers_0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29818091/226423880-d7068268-8707-4f1a-b40b-6001bf183ab7.jpg)

This project aims to analyze data related to different beers served in Saint Petersburg, Russia. By analyzing this data the following points could be achieved.

1	Understanding beer preferences: Analyzing the dataset can help identify popular beer types, brands, and breweries. This information can be useful for breweries to understand customer preferences and develop new products.<br />
2	Optimizing beer distribution: Knowing the location of popular bars can help breweries optimize their distribution network and ensure their products are available at the right places.<br />
3	Identifying trends: By analyzing the ratings of different beers, breweries can identify trends and adjust their products accordingly. For instance, if there is a trend towards hoppy beers, breweries can create more of these to meet the demand.<br />
4	Marketing and advertising: By analyzing the dataset, breweries can identify popular bars and locations and target their marketing and advertising efforts towards those areas.<br />
5	Improving customer experience: Understanding customer preferences can help breweries improve their product offerings and provide a better customer experience. For example, if customers prefer lighter beers, breweries can offer more of these options.<br />
6	Identifying opportunities for growth: Analyzing the dataset can help breweries identify gaps in the market and areas where they can expand their offerings. For instance, if there are no popular breweries in a particular location, a brewery can consider opening a new location in that area.<br />

In summary, exploring this dataset can provide valuable insights for breweries and help them make data-driven decisions to improve their products, distribution, and overall performance.

## Step 1: Data Exploration
Before starting with the analysis, it's important to understand the data. We can start by running some basic SQL queries to explore the data.

Count the total number of different beers in the database:
```
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT beer) as Unique_beers
FROM beer;
```
| Unique_beers |
| ------------ |
| 9516         |

Find the total number of breweries in the database:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT brewery) as Unique_breweries  
FROM beer;
```
| Unique_breweries |
| ---------------- |
| 1646             |

Find the total number of bars in the database:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bar) as Unique_bars  
FROM beer;
```
| Unique_bars  |
| ------------ |
| 1354         |

Find the highest rated beer in the database:
```
SELECT beer, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating 
FROM beer 
GROUP BY beer 
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
| Beer                                   | Avg_rating |

|Рычал, ссу	                             | 5.0        |

Find the lowest rated beer in the database:
```
SELECT beer, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating 
FROM beer 
GROUP BY beer 
ORDER BY avg_rating ASC;
```
| Beer                                   | Avg_rating |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- |

|2014-10	         | 11             |

## Step 3: Data Visualization

I created a bar chart showing the total number of check-ins for each month. I used this query to pull the relevant data out of the database.
```
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month, COUNT(*) AS total_checkins 
FROM beer 
GROUP BY month 
ORDER BY month;
```
