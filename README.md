# Personal-Projects

Welcome to my personal project repository! As an aspiring data analyst, I am constantly working on projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in the field. This repository is a collection of some of my best projects that demonstrate my abilities in data analysis & visualization.

Some of the projects you'll find here include exploratory data analysis of real-world datasets and data visualization using tools like PowerBI & tableau. I have also included some projects that demonstrate my proficiency in SQL.

Each project comes with a detailed README file that explains the problem statement, the data used, the analysis methodology, and the results obtained. Feel free to explore the code and documentation, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find my projects insightful and informative!

# Project 1: Supermarket sales.
This project aims to analyze supermarket sales data to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior using SQL. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets, making it an ideal method for analyzing data.

The analysis will involve extracting the relevant data from the supermarket sales CSV file, and querying it to identify key metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics. We will then use SQL queries and aggregation functions to identify trends over time, identify patterns in customer behavior, and understand the factors that influence sales.

By using SQL, we can efficiently query and analyze large datasets, which is essential for gaining meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior. Additionally, using SQL allows for easy replication of the analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.

The project will be documented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations of the SQL queries used and the insights gained. This will allow for easy replication of the analysis and help others to understand the value of using SQL for analyzing sales data.
