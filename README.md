# Project 1: Supermarket sales:
This project utilizes SQL to analyze supermarket sales data in order to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets, making it an ideal method for analyzing data. With this project, we will extract relevant data from a supermarket sales CSV file and use SQL queries and aggregation functions to identify key metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics.

Using SQL to analyze the data allows for efficient querying and analysis of large datasets, which is essential for gaining meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior. This makes SQL a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.

Throughout this project, I will document the analysis in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations of the SQL queries used and the insights gained. This will not only allow for easy replication of the analysis but also provide a better understanding of the value of using SQL for analyzing sales data.

In summary, this project showcases my proficiency in SQL and my ability to use it as a powerful tool to analyze data and gain valuable insights.

# Project 3: Saint Petersburg Craft Beer:

This project is focused on analyzing data related to different beers served in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and my SQL skills will come in handy. By delving into this data, we can achieve a number of objectives.

Firstly, by analyzing the dataset, we can gain an understanding of the preferences of beer drinkers in Saint Petersburg. This can help us identify popular beer types, brands, and breweries, which will be valuable information for breweries looking to understand customer preferences and develop new products.

Additionally, we can use this data to optimize the distribution of beer. By identifying the locations of popular bars and breweries, breweries can ensure that their products are available at the right places, thus improving their distribution network.

Furthermore, we can identify trends by analyzing the ratings of different beers, which can help breweries adjust their products accordingly. For example, if there is a trend towards hoppy beers, breweries can create more of these to meet the demand.

Marketing and advertising efforts can also be targeted towards popular bars and locations by analyzing the dataset. This will help breweries identify the areas where their products are most in demand and focus their marketing efforts there.

Moreover, understanding customer preferences can help breweries improve their product offerings and provide a better customer experience. For example, if customers prefer lighter beers, breweries can offer more of these options.

Finally, analyzing the dataset can help breweries identify opportunities for growth. By identifying gaps in the market and areas where they can expand their offerings, breweries can consider opening new locations or introducing new products.

In conclusion, exploring this dataset using my SQL skills can provide valuable insights for breweries and help them make data-driven decisions to improve their products, distribution, and overall performance.

# Project 4: The Pizza Project:

As a data analyst, I was approached by a client named Ben who is planning to start a new pizza delivery and take-out restaurant in his town. He requested me to design and build a relational database that will enable him to store and manage all the critical data related to his business operations. The objective of the project is to help Ben monitor the performance of his business through insightful dashboards. The key areas of focus for the database are orders, stock control, and staff management. The database will serve as a valuable tool for Ben to make data-driven decisions and ensure the success of his business.

As part of the project, I went beyond just writing queries and extracting data. I also created three different dashboards using Google Looker, which allowed me to visualize and present data in a user-friendly way.

The different tables and the relationship between them have been drawn using QuickDBD. After connecting all the tables, the relational SQL database will look like this:

The first dashboard focused on order activity, providing valuable insights into sales trends, top-selling items, and customer preferences.

The second dashboard was more complex, involving inventory management, where I needed to calculate inventory usage and identify which items needed reordering. I also calculated the cost of each pizza based on the cost of ingredients, enabling me to monitor pricing and profits.

The third and final dashboard was relatively simple, focusing on staff management and costs.

Throughout the project, my SQL and dashboarding skills were put to the test. I had to create a relational database with multiple tables and set up relationships between them, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. I also had to write SQL queries to extract and manipulate data, as well as create visually appealing and informative dashboards to present this data in a clear and concise manner. Overall, this project provided me with valuable experience in database design and management, SQL programming, and dashboarding, which I can apply to future projects and career opportunities.

# Project 5: Covid 19 Vaccine Tracker:
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people all over the world, and one of the most important ways to combat it, is through vaccinations. To monitor the progress of the global vaccination program, I decided to make a dashboard using Tableau. The main goal of the dashboard was to showcase my Tableau skills and my ability to translate data into a comprehensive dashboard.

The dashboard displays critical information on the vaccination program's progress worldwide. It provides a quick overview of the share of the world population that has not been vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated. The dashboard includes a stacked bar chart that compares the number of people who are partially vaccinated to those who are fully vaccinated, providing an easy-to-understand visual representation of the data.

Another crucial feature of the dashboard is an interactive world map that shows the percentage of people with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Users can interact with the map to explore the data for specific countries or regions. Additionally, a line chart shows the number of vaccines administered daily, which can help track trends in vaccine distribution.

Finally, the dashboard investigates the correlation between a country's GDP per capita and its vaccination rates. It provides a clear understanding of whether wealthier countries have more success in vaccinating their populations than poorer countries.

In summary, the COVID vaccine tracker dashboard is an excellent tool for monitoring the progress of the global vaccination program. It provides critical information to help track the effectiveness of the program and identify areas that need improvement. The dashboard's various features make it an interactive and user-friendly tool that can be useful for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public.
