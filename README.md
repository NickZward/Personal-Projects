# Personal-Projects

Welcome to my personal project repository! As an aspiring data analyst, I am constantly working on projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in the field. This repository is a collection of some of my best projects that demonstrate my abilities in data analysis & visualization.

Some of the projects you'll find here include exploratory data analysis of real-world datasets and data visualization using tools like PowerBI & tableau. I have also included some projects that demonstrate my proficiency in SQL.

Each project comes with a detailed README file that explains the problem statement, the data used, the analysis methodology, and the results obtained. Feel free to explore the code and documentation, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find my projects insightful and informative!

# Project 1: Supermarket sales:
This project aims to analyze supermarket sales data to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior using SQL. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets, making it an ideal method for analyzing data.

The analysis will involve extracting the relevant data from the supermarket sales CSV file, and querying it to identify key metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics. We will then use SQL queries and aggregation functions to identify trends over time, identify patterns in customer behavior, and understand the factors that influence sales.

By using SQL, we can efficiently query and analyze large datasets, which is essential for gaining meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior. Additionally, using SQL allows for easy replication of the analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.

The project will be documented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations of the SQL queries used and the insights gained. This will allow for easy replication of the analysis and help others to understand the value of using SQL for analyzing sales data.

# Project 2: Restaurants Tallinn:
The project aims to analyze data related to restaurants in Tallinn, Estonia. The dataset includes several columns such as Restaurant name, Address, Cuisine type, Average bill, Atmosphere, Food quality, Service rating, and Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The analysis will focus on exploring various aspects of the restaurant industry in Tallinn, such as popular cuisine types, average bills, customer satisfaction ratings, and more. The data will be extracted, transformed, and loaded into the relational database management system called MySQL.

The project will involve several steps such as cleaning the data, creating tables, running queries, and visualizing the results using tools such as Tableau or Power BI. The final report will present insights and recommendations based on the analysis, which can help restaurant owners, food enthusiasts, and tourists make informed decisions.

# Project 3: Saint Petersburg Craft Beer:

This project aims to analyze data related to different beers served in Saint Petersburg, Russia. By analyzing this data the following points could be achieved.

1. Understanding beer preferences: Analyzing the dataset can help identify popular beer types, brands, and breweries. This information can be useful for breweries to understand customer preferences and develop new products.<br />
2. Optimizing beer distribution: Knowing the location of popular bars can help breweries optimize their distribution network and ensure their products are available at the right places.<br />
3. Identifying trends: By analyzing the ratings of different beers, breweries can identify trends and adjust their products accordingly. For instance, if there is a trend towards hoppy beers, breweries can create more of these to meet the demand.<br />
4. Marketing and advertising: By analyzing the dataset, breweries can identify popular bars and locations and target their marketing and advertising efforts towards those areas.<br />
5. Improving customer experience: Understanding customer preferences can help breweries improve their product offerings and provide a better customer experience. For example, if customers prefer lighter beers, breweries can offer more of these options.<br />
6. Identifying opportunities for growth: Analyzing the dataset can help breweries identify gaps in the market and areas where they can expand their offerings. For instance, if there are no popular breweries in a particular location, a brewery can consider opening a new location in that area.

In summary, exploring this dataset can provide valuable insights for breweries and help them make data-driven decisions to improve their products, distribution, and overall performance.

# Project 4: The Pizza Project:

During this project I wanted to do more than just write queries and extract data. This project includes creating a relational SQL databse, writing SQL queries to create the data sources for a dashboard & building 3 different dashboards using Google Looker.

This dataset wil consist of an order data table, a customers table, an address table, an item table, an ingridient table, a recipe table, an inventory table, a shift table, a staff table and a rota table.

The different tables and the relationship between them have been drawn using QuickDBD. After connecting all the tables, the relational SQL database will look like this:
