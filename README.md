# Personal-Projects

Hello and welcome to my personal project repository!

As an aspiring data analyst, I am continuously working on projects that showcase my skills and knowledge in the field. This repository serves as a collection of some of my best projects that demonstrate my abilities in data analysis and visualization.

You'll find a variety of projects here, including exploratory data analysis of real-world datasets and data visualization using tools like PowerBI and Tableau. Additionally, I have included some projects that demonstrate my proficiency in SQL.

Each project in this repository is accompanied by a detailed README file. This file explains the problem statement, the data used, the analysis methodology, and the results obtained. I encourage you to explore the code and documentation, and please don't hesitate to share your feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you find my projects insightful and informative!

# Project 1: Supermarket sales:
This project aims to analyze supermarket sales data to gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior using SQL. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets, making it an ideal method for analyzing data.

The analysis will involve extracting the relevant data from the supermarket sales CSV file, and querying it to identify key metrics such as sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics. We will then use SQL queries and aggregation functions to identify trends over time, identify patterns in customer behavior, and understand the factors that influence sales.

By using SQL, we can efficiently query and analyze large datasets, which is essential for gaining meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior. Additionally, using SQL allows for easy replication of the analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.

The project will be documented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations of the SQL queries used and the insights gained. This will allow for easy replication of the analysis and help others to understand the value of using SQL for analyzing sales data.

# Project 2: Restaurants Tallinn:
The project aims to analyze data related to restaurants in Tallinn, Estonia. The dataset includes several columns such as Restaurant name, Address, Cuisine type, Average bill, Atmosphere, Food quality, Service rating, and Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The analysis will focus on exploring various aspects of the restaurant industry in Tallinn, such as popular cuisine types, average bills, customer satisfaction ratings, and more. The data will be extracted, transformed, and loaded into the relational database management system called MySQL.

The project will involve several steps such as cleaning the data, creating tables, running queries, and visualizing the results using tools such as Tableau or Power BI. The final report will present insights and recommendations based on the analysis, which can help restaurant owners, food enthusiasts, and tourists make informed decisions.

# Project 3: Saint Petersburg Craft Beer:

This project aims to analyze data related to different beers served in Saint Petersburg, Russia. By analyzing this data the following points could be achieved.

1. Understanding beer preferences: Analyzing the dataset can help identify popular beer types, brands, and breweries. This information can be useful for breweries to understand customer preferences and develop new products.<br />
2. Optimizing beer distribution: Knowing the location of popular bars can help breweries optimize their distribution network and ensure their products are available at the right places.<br />
3. Identifying trends: By analyzing the ratings of different beers, breweries can identify trends and adjust their products accordingly. For instance, if there is a trend towards hoppy beers, breweries can create more of these to meet the demand.<br />
4. Marketing and advertising: By analyzing the dataset, breweries can identify popular bars and locations and target their marketing and advertising efforts towards those areas.<br />
5. Improving customer experience: Understanding customer preferences can help breweries improve their product offerings and provide a better customer experience. For example, if customers prefer lighter beers, breweries can offer more of these options.<br />
6. Identifying opportunities for growth: Analyzing the dataset can help breweries identify gaps in the market and areas where they can expand their offerings. For instance, if there are no popular breweries in a particular location, a brewery can consider opening a new location in that area.

In summary, exploring this dataset can provide valuable insights for breweries and help them make data-driven decisions to improve their products, distribution, and overall performance.

# Project 4: The Pizza Project:

I got a task from a fictional person named Ben. Ben is opening a new pizzeria in his town. It won't be a dine in. Just a delivery and take out restaurant. He has given me a project brief. The first part is to design and build a relational database for his business that will allow him to store all the important data the business collects and generates. This will in turn help Ben monitor business performance in dashboards. The main areas of focus are orders, stock control and staff.

During this project I wanted to do more than just write queries and extract data. This project includes creating a relational SQL databse, writing SQL queries to create the data sources for a dashboard & building 3 different dashboards using Google Looker.

This dataset wil consist of an order data table, a customers table, an address table, an item table, an ingridient table, a recipe table, an inventory table, a shift table, a staff table and a rota table.

The different tables and the relationship between them have been drawn using QuickDBD. After connecting all the tables, the relational SQL database will look like this:
![Screenshot 2023-03-22 at 5 01 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29818091/226965890-71248a15-746f-4247-baf7-a951c90cbf98.png)

The first dashboard contains information about order activity. This dashboard contains information such as:<br />
Total orders, total sales, total items, average order value, sales by category, top selling items, orders by hour, sales by hour, orders by address, orders by delivery/pick up.

The second dashboard is all about inventory management. This will be a lot more complicated than the orders. Mainly because I needed to calculate how much. inventory will be used and then I have to identify inventory that needs reordering. I also want to calculate how much each pizza costs to make based on the cost of the ingredients so that I can keep an eye on pricing and P/L. This dashboard contains information such as: <br />
Total quantity by ingredient, total cost of ingredients, calculated cost of pizza, percentage stock remaining by ingedient. 

The third dashboard was by far the simpelest to make. I wanted to be able to monitor who was working on any given day or shift and what the overall staff costs were. This dashboard contains information such as:<br />
Total staff cost, Total hours worked, Hours worked by staff member, Cost per staff member.

In this SQL project, I learned how to design and build a relational database for a pizza delivery and take-out restaurant. The database stored important data related to orders, stock control, and staff. I learned how to create tables, set up relationships between them, and insert, update, and delete data. I also learned how to write SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database and generate reports to help Ben monitor business performance. This project provided me with practical skills in database design and management, as well as proficiency in SQL programming.
