# Project 1: Supermarket sales:

The objective of this project is to analyze the data of a supermarket's sales to obtain insights into sales trends and customer behavior by utilizing SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is an effective tool for managing and querying large datasets, which makes it a suitable method for analyzing data.

The analysis process involves extracting the appropriate data from the supermarket sales CSV file and using queries to identify key metrics like sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics. Then, SQL queries and aggregation functions are used to determine trends over time, detect patterns in customer behavior, and understand the factors that influence sales.

Using SQL facilitates efficient querying and analysis of large datasets, which is essential for obtaining meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior. Additionally, employing SQL makes it easy to replicate the analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes.

The project will be documented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed explanations of the SQL queries used and the insights obtained. This will enable the easy replication of the analysis and help others understand the value of using SQL for sales data analysis.

## About the dataset:
The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. The dataset is one of the historical sales of a supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data.

## Objective: Analyzing the sales data to understand sales trends and customer behavior!
Understanding sales trends and customer behavior by analyzing sales data can provide businesses with valuable insights to improve their sales performance, inventory management, pricing strategies, and identify opportunities for growth. By analyzing data, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, forecast demand, plan inventory, and identify the most effective pricing points for different products. In short, analyzing sales data can help businesses make data-driven decisions that can improve their overall profitability and success.

### **Data Exploration:**<br /> 
When analyzing a dataset, it's important to first explore the data to understand its structure and relationships. This is typically done by using SQL queries to extract basic information such as the number of records, unique values, and data types.

For example, the number of records will give you an idea of how much data you're dealing with, while the unique values can help you identify any potential issues or anomalies in the data. The data types will help you understand the nature of the data, such as whether it's numerical or categorical, and whether any transformations may be needed to use it effectively.

By exploring the data in this way, you can get a better understanding of the dataset and identify any issues or patterns that may need further 
investigation. It can also help you determine the best methods to use when analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights.
