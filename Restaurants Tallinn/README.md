# Project 2: Restaurants Tallinn

The project aims to analyze data related to restaurants in Tallinn, Estonia. The dataset includes several columns such as Restaurant name, Address, 
Cuisine type, Average bill, Atmosphere, Food quality, Service rating, and Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The analysis will focus on exploring various aspects of the restaurant industry in Tallinn, such as popular cuisine types, average bills, 
customer satisfaction ratings, and more. The data will be extracted, transformed, and loaded into the relational database management system called MySQL.

The project will involve several steps such as cleaning the data, creating tables, running queries, and visualizing the results using tools

food enthusiasts, and tourists make informed decisions.
