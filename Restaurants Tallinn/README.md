# Project 2: Restaurants Tallinn.

The project aims to analyze data related to restaurants in Tallinn, Estonia. The dataset includes several columns such as Restaurant name, Address, 
Cuisine type, Average bill, Atmosphere, Food quality, Service rating, and Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The analysis will focus on exploring various aspects of the restaurant industry in Tallinn, such as popular cuisine types, average bills, 
customer satisfaction ratings, and more. The data will be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a relational database management system such
