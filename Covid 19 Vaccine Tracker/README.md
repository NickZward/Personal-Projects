The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people all over the world, and one of the most important ways to combat it, is through vaccinations. To monitor the progress of the global vaccination program, I decided to make a dashboard using Tableau. The main goal of the dashboard was to showcase my Tableau skills and my ability to translate data into a comprehensive dashboard.

The dashboard displays critical information on the vaccination program's progress worldwide. It provides a quick overview of the share of the world population that has not been vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated. The dashboard includes a stacked bar chart that compares the number of people who are partially vaccinated to those who are fully vaccinated, providing an easy-to-understand visual representation of the data.

Another crucial feature of the dashboard is an interactive world map that shows the percentage of people with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Users can interact with the map to explore the data for specific countries or regions. Additionally, a line chart shows the number of vaccines administered daily, which can help track trends in vaccine distribution.

Finally, the dashboard investigates the correlation between a country's GDP per capita and its vaccination rates. It provides a clear understanding of whether wealthier countries have more success in vaccinating their populations than poorer countries.

In summary, the COVID vaccine tracker dashboard is an excellent tool for monitoring the progress of the global vaccination program. It provides critical information to help track the effectiveness of the program and identify areas that need improvement. The dashboard's various features make it an interactive and user-friendly tool that can be useful for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public.
